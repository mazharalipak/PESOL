# PESOL Package for Power Systems Analysis 
# Matpower-TENR
TENR Algorithm
There are four different folders for different choices of Transversality:
1) TENR_EIG (Right eigenvector Transversality)
2) TENR_LU (LU Transversality) 
3) TENR_QR (QR Transversality)
4) TENR_SVD (SVD Transversality)

Kindly, readme.text file in each folder in order to run these transversality choices for the of testing different IEEE cases.

# Install the corresponding folders in the latest version of the Matpower for computation.
